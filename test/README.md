## How to write some tests?

### 0. Environment setup

Install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Run the tests:
```sh
npm run test
```

Access the url: localhost:8080.

Open devtools in the browser and go to the console tab to see the test results.

### 1. Create a test file

Create a file with the name of the test you want to write, for example `/test/code1.ts`.
You can name it whatever you want, but it's recommended to name it as a sequence of after the last test number.

### 2. Write the test
```ts
export const code1 = {
    name: "declare",
    code: `DECLARE i: INTEGER
DECLARE j: INTEGER
DECLARE k: REAL

INPUT i
INPUT j
INPUT k
OUTPUT i + j * k
    `,
    input: [3, 2, 3.14],
    // floatring point inaccuracy
    expected: [3 + 2 * 3.14],
    // cannot be used yet
    error: [],
};
```
The test is a simple object with the following properties:
- `name`: The name of the test, it's recommended to name it as the name of the test file.
- `code`: The code to be tested.
- `input`: The input to be passed to the code.
- `expected`: The expected output of the code.
- `error`: The expected error of the code.

### 3. Add the test to the test list

Open the file `/test/index.ts` and add the test to the list `tests`:
```ts
import { code1 } from "./code1";

export const tests = [
    ...
    code1,
];
```
